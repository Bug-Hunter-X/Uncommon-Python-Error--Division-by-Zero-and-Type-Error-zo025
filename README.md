This repository contains a Python code example that demonstrates an uncommon error: division by zero and type error when dividing a number by a string. The bug.py file shows the code that produces the error, while the bugSolution.py file provides a solution to handle the error gracefully. The solution involves using a try-except block to catch the ZeroDivisionError and TypeError exceptions, thus preventing program crashes.  This is a simple example to illustrate a potentially problematic scenario.
